# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Classification

This project is a classic machine learning classification task based on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and port of embarkation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a machine learning model that can predict passenger survival using the Titanic dataset.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Fill missing values
   - Drop unnecessary columns
3. **Feature Encoding**
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
4. **Model Training**
   - Train-test split
   - Random Forest Classifier
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
6. **Visualization (optional)**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- The model was evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics.
- Visualization was used to explore survival trends by gender and class.
